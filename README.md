# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
  <p>
   The school board has notified that the "students_complete.csv" file shows evidence of academic dishonesty on "reading" and "math" grades for Thomas High School ninth graders  which appears to have been altered.
  
  Also the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, so they want to hold on state-testing standards and need help to solve this problem.
    Their requirement is to make Thomas High School with NaNs, so that rest of the data will remain intact.
</p>

## Purpose 
  <p>
  The purpose of this project is to analyze the School District data on basis of school budget, students scores as per their grades.
  Also to learn new insights which will give us clear view of results on each schools performance. 
  </P>

 ## Requirements:
  - A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
  - An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
  - Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school
  </p>
